    <p>Example live demo is [btn link="https://adrianvla.github.io/8BIT-JS-Example/"]here[/btn]</p>
    <p>The game engine uses HTML5 Canvas, and sprite sheets. You can even create an infinite scroll with parallax and particle systems.</p>
    <p>The project's repository and explanation is [a href="https://github.com/adrianvla/8BIT-JS"]here[/a] . Have Fun making retro / normal games!</p>
    <p>Documentation is in the README.md file in the repo. The physics module isn't fully finished though. It's almost like Scratch, but faster and with javascript (like it uses the functions put(), stamp(), etc.. like Scratch).</p>
