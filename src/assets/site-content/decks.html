    <h1>Why did I make this?</h1>
    <p>I was using [a href="https://www.studysmarter.de/"]StudySmarter[/a] to prepare for exams. It was buggy when I was creating flashcards at a very fast pace, not waiting before creating another one.</p>
    <p>2 days before my Calculus I Part 1 exam, StudySmarter decided it was a good idea to make half of my flashcards disappear for no reason at all. Well, the reason was that quickly creating flashcards on that platform was already unstable.</p>
    <p>This made me roll out my first prototype of this app in 1 week, which I used for the second part of my Calculus I exam (it was split in 2 parts).</p>
    <p>I never used StudySmarter again, and advise everyone to stay away from it because of it's bugs.</p>
    <p>Unlike that app, Decks supports fast flashcard creation and is made to protect your flashcards at all costs.</p>
