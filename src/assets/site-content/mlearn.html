    <h1>Why did I make this?</h1>
    <p>This app's development was started around the Summer/Autumn of 2024. I started learning Japanese in February 2024 and was looking to immerse. But all native media were basically inaccessible to me because of my complete beginner level at that time. </p>
    <p>I was looking for an app that would let me immerse with any content I wanted, and even offline one. Something that would have Anki integration. I found [a href="https://migaku.com/"]Migaku[/a], but it wasn't free unfortunately, nor did it allow me to jump to a whole new level of language complexity (media for natives,...).</p>
    <p>This sparked my interest in making a complete language learning app where I could learn by immersion, even with a very basic level.</p>
    <p>Since my level was tiny at the time and I couldn't understand 99% of the Japanese media, I invented a live word translator: it automatically appends translations of words based on their readings.</p>
    <p>This helped me a lot, as the first piece of media I tried to watch using my app was [a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2098220/"]Hunter x Hunter[/a], with Japanese subtitles and original dub.</p>
    <p>This app got me to conversational fluency, and I learned over 1000 words with it effortlessly (I discovered this incredible number when I went through an internal database of mLearn).</p>
    <h1>Planned Features</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>A Custom SRS System</li>
        <li>Language Exam study mode (to prepare you vocabulary-wise to exams like JLPT by selecting vocabulary)</li>
        <li>Chinese & Russian language support</li>
        <li>And Many More...</li>
    </ul>
