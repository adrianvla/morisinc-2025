    <h1>Features</h1>
    <p>Movable widgets, multiple screen environments, animations.<br>
    A control panel in which you can edit just about everything, widget position, widget code etc.</p>
    <p>You don't have to worry about the built-in clock in Raspberry-Pi Zero slightly changing over time, because every now and then this software automatically synchronizes with a time server online.</p>
    <h2>Widgets</h2>
    <p>Widgets that are provided out-of-the-box:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Days of Week (with bars that look like this if you're on a Saturday: ░░ ░░ ░░ ░░ ░░ ▓▓ ░░)</li>
        <li>Calendar (indicates the current date with a nice calendar-like background)</li>
        <li>Digital Time: 3x5 font, HH : MM (: SS, configurable)</li>
        <li>Big Digital Time: 5x5 font, HH : MM</li>
        <li>Rss Feed: Scrolls news headlines on the display, 8x8 font, supports Latin, Cyrillic, Japanese Kana&Kanji</li>
        <li>Temperature: temperature°C</li>
        <li>Weather: A nice 8x8 widget with animated icons for every weather type, with even a particle system for rain</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Screens</h2>
    <p>Screens are like Desktops on Windows or on Mac, with widgets placed on them, and based on time/events (like if the clock recieves an RSS update from a news source) the screens will cycle with a nice little animation.</p>
    <h2>Control panel</h2>
    <p>With the help of the control panel you can do a lot of things:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Change the password</li>
        <li>View what's on the display</li>
        <li>Change the brightness</li>
        <li>Restart</li>
        <li>Edit Widgets / Create new ones using JavaScript right in your browser (using Monaco Editor)</li>
        <li>Edit Screens / Create new ones by dragging and dropping the widgets on a virtual screen</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>How to Use</h1>
    <p>Get an API key from weatherapi.com<br>
    Paste it in the file <code>/code/src/widgets/weather/weather.js</code> (WIP, will be moved to the Control Panel)</p>
    <p>Put your RSS feeds in the file <code>/code/src/widgets/rssFeed/rss.js</code> (WIP, will also be moved to be edited in the Control Panel)</p>
    <p>Create a systemctl service to autorun</p>
    <pre style="color:#fff">#!/bin/bash
cd &lt;the directory you're doing to put the contents of the code folder in&gt;
sudo node src/main.js
</pre>
    <p>and name it <code>script-startup.service</code></p>
    <p>And you're good to go.</p>
    <p>To connect the ws281x screen, connect it to GPIO 18, or change the <code>/code/src/utils/driver.js</code> file to another pin.</p>
