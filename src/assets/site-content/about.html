    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Adrian. I was born in 2007 and have been passionate about technology from an early age. I began programming around the age of five or six.</p>
    <p>I build applications, websites, hardware and did design on FPGA. I also compose music and enjoy taking on challenging projects. I am a language enthusiast.</p>
    <p>My interests span software development, hardware design, and science. Anything technological, novel, or research-driven sparks my curiosity.</p>
    <p>My [btn link="https://github.com/adrianvla/"]GitHub[/btn] profile is also available [a href="https://github.com/adrianvla/"]here[/a].</p>
    <p>I first learned C, followed by C++. Before programming in JavaScript, I worked extensively in Scratch. [a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/adri1012018/"]Here[/a] is my Scratch profile. </p>
    <p>I completed the JavaScript course on [a href="https://www.sololearn.com/"]Sololearn[/a] in 2018.</p>

    <p>I also participated in the [a href="https://www.epfl.ch/education/education-and-science-outreach/fr/gymnasiens/cours-turing/"]Turing Course[/a], a two-year program, winning both annual contests.</p>

    </ul>
    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>I am a transhumanist. I believe robotics should support humanity in every possible way, and that society should benefit from technological progress. I also believe that knowledge is a human right and should be freely accessible to all.</p>
    <p>Technologies such as exoskeletons and advanced prosthetics can transform lives, especially for people with disabilities.</p>
    <p>As computers approach human-level cognition and emotional understanding and outright true emotions, they could accelerate innovation, science, and society at large. Such capabilities must be developed and deployed responsibly.</p>
    <p>Technological disruption can lead to misconceptions and fears of replacement. Preparing society for change will be essential to live in harmony with such advanced technology.</p>
